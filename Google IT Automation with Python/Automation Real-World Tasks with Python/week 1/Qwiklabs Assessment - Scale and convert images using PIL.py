"""
Write a Python script
This is the challenge section of the lab where you'll write a script that uses PIL to perform the following operations:
Iterate through each file in the folder
For each file:
Rotate the image 90Â° clockwise
Resize the image from 192x192 to 128x128
Save the image to a new folder in .jpeg format
Use a nano editor for this purpose. You can name the file however you'd like. And make sure to save the updated images in the folder: /opt/icons/
You'll use lots of methods from PIL to complete this exercise. 
You can refer to Pillow for detailed explanations and have a look at the tutorials to help you build the script and complete the task.
